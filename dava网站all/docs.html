                    Hey ther! You're looking at the docs for an Official Bootstrap Theme-thanks for your purchase! This theme has been lovingly crafted by Bootstrap's founders and friends to help you build awesome projects on the web. Let's dive in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each theme is designed as it's own toolkit-a series of welldesigned, intuitive, and cohesive components-built on top of Bootstrap. If you've used Bootstrap itself, you'll find this all super familiar. but with new aesthetics, new components, beautiful and extensive examples, and easy-to-use build tools and documentation.
                </p>

                    Thanks, and enjoy!
